<h3>2021 Mercedes Metris Getaway Camper Van - Low Mileage, Excellent Condition<h3>

<h2>Description<h2>
<p>Perfect for weekend getaways or extended road trips. 
We have loved using this van over the last couple of years. 
However we now need two smaller daily drivers and less time to camp for next few years, we would love for the villa to bring joy to someone else.</p>
